I'm a post-doc research fellow at the University of Michigan, working with Prof. [Dmitry Berenson](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dmitryb/). From 2019 to 2022, I was a post-doc researcher at [CNR-STIIMA](https://www.stiima.cnr.it/?lang=en) with Dr. [Nicola Pedrocchi](https://www.stiima.cnr.it/ricercatori/nicola-pedrocchi/?lang=en). I got my M.Sc. and PhD in robotics from the University of Brescia, Italy, in 2019 under the supervision of Prof. [Antonio Visioli](https://antonio-visioli.unibs.it/) and Prof. [Manuel Beschi](https://cari.unibs.it/home-page).

My main research interest is in motion planning in challenging scenarios (e.g., planning with unreliable models and human-robot collaboration) and human-aware decision making.
