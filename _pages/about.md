I'm a post-doc research fellow at the University of Michigan, working with Prof. [Dmitry Berenson](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dmitryb/). From 2019 to 2022, I was a post-doc researcher at the [CNR-STIIMA](https://www.stiima.cnr.it/?lang=en). I got my M.Sc. and PhD in robotics from the University of Brescia, Italy, in 2019 under the supervision of Prof. [Antonio Visioli](https://antonio-visioli.unibs.it/}{Antonio Visioli).

My main research interest is in motion planning in challenging scenarios (e.g., planning with unreliable models and human-robot collaboration).
