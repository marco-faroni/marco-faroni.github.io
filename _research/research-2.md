title: "Sampling-based motion planning"
excerpt: "New challenges continously arise in motion planning, e.g., planning with complex dynamics or black-box model, manipulation planning with time-critical requirements or under uncertainty.
I am interested in designing new algorithms for sampling-based motion planning in challenging problems such as kinodynamic motion planning and high-dimensional problems.
