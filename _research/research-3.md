title: "MPC for path following of redundant manipulators"
excerpt: "When a robot has more degrees of freedom greater than those strictly necessary to carry out a task, it is said to be kinematically redundant.
The additional degrees of freedom allow for posture optimization (e.g. to avoid obstacles or improve dexterity). 
I've designed model-predictive-control methods to exploit the robot redundancy at best
and achieve optimal path following, even when the desired tasks drive the robot outside its joint physical limits."
