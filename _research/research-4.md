title: "Real-time trajectory scaling for optimal path following"
excerpt: "Robot often need to adapt the trajectory on the fly to prevent collisions or tracking errors. 
The physical limits of the robot joints do not allow for error-free trajectory scaling or stopping, which is why online trajectory scaling is often needed to reduce the robot path error.
I've worked on the formulation of real-time (<1ms) trajectory scaling methods using model predictive control (MPC) and look-ahead techniques to reduce the robot path error in the case of 
redundant and non-redundant robots, and joint-space and Cartesian-space tasks.
