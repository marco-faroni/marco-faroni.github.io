title: "Human-aware decision making for collaborative robotics"
excerpt: "Poor robot planning hinders the effectiveness of human-robot collaboration. This includes
conservative implementation of safety rules, planning of
trajectories that interfere with human movements, and nonoptimized
design and execution of complex tasks.
I am interested in developing all-around planning algorithms for effective and safe human-robot collaboration, spanning path planning and re-planning, trajectory control, and task-and-motion planning.
